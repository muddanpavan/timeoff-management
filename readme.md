## Architecture Overview

The application is deployed on AWS with the following components:

- Amazon ECS for container orchestration.
- Amazon RDS for database storage (not included in this script).
- AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for load balancing HTTPS traffic.
- Two subnets in different Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS account and access keys.
2. Docker installed locally.
3. Terraform installed locally.
4. GitHub repository with the Timeo2 Management application source code.
